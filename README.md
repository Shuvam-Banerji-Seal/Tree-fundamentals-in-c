## Binary Search Tree Implementation in JavaScript

This JavaScript code implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) with a user-friendly menu for performing various operations. The tree structure efficiently stores and retrieves numerical data while maintaining a sorted order.

**Key Features:**

- User Menu: Interactively perform BST operations through a menu-driven interface.
- Insertion: Add new nodes to the tree, maintaining the BST property.
- Deletion: Remove nodes from the tree while preserving the BST order.
- Search: Find specific nodes by their value.
- Height Calculation: Determine the maximum level of nodes in the tree.
- Traversals: Explore the tree using different traversal methods:
    - Inorder: Visit left subtree, root, then right subtree.
    - Preorder: Visit root, left subtree, then right subtree.
    - Postorder: Visit left subtree, right subtree, then root.
    - Level order: Visit nodes level by level, starting from the root.
- Traversal Information: Provides descriptions of each traversal method.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Prerequisites:** Basic understanding of JavaScript and data structures (trees).
2. **Running the Code:**
   - Save the code as a JavaScript file (e.g., `bst.js`).
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the file.
   - Run the code using Node.js: `node bst.js`

**Code Structure:**

The code is well-structured with clear function definitions and comments, making it easy to understand and modify.

**Explanation of Functions:**

**1. `createNode(data)`:**
   - Creates a new tree node with the given `data` value and initializes `left` and `right` child pointers to `null`.

**2. `insert(data)`:**
   - Recursively inserts a new node with the given `data` value into the BST, maintaining the sorted order.

**3. `delete(data)`:**
   - Searches for a node with the given `data` value and deletes it using appropriate BST deletion techniques.

**4. `search(data)`:**
   - Recursively searches for a node with the given `data` value and returns `true` if found, `false` otherwise.

**5. `height(root)`:**
   - Calculates the height (maximum level) of the BST recursively.

**6. `inorder(root)`:**
   - Performs an inorder traversal, visiting the left subtree, root, and then the right subtree.

**7. `preorder(root)`:**
   - Performs a preorder traversal, visiting the root, left subtree, and then the right subtree.

**8. `postorder(root)`:**
   - Performs a postorder traversal, visiting the left subtree, right subtree, and then the root.

**9. `levelOrder(root)`:**
   - Performs a level-order traversal, visiting nodes level by level from the root.

**10. `menu()`:**
   - Presents a menu with options for insertion, deletion, search, height calculation, traversals, and traversal information. Takes user input to execute the selected operation.

**11. `traversalInfo()`:**
   - Displays information about the different traversal methods.

**12. `main()`:**
   - Calls the `menu()` function to start the user interaction.

**Enhancements:**

- Error handling: Implement checks for invalid user input and provide appropriate error messages.
- Efficiency improvements: Consider optimizations for specific operations, especially for large datasets.
- Visualizations: Create visualizations of the BST for better understanding (optional).

**Future Considerations:**

- Balance checking: Implement mechanisms like AVL trees or red-black trees to maintain better balance for frequent insertions and deletions.
- Generic data types: Modify the code to handle different data types stored in the nodes.
